Trends - ***primary, intermediate, short-term***

Be sure to identify the primary trend and whether it appears to be strong or running out of steam. It's helpful to use a long-term chart to identify the trend and use the intermediate-term and short-term charts to help drill down the exact entry and exit levels.

“Increased depth is a sign of potential trend weakness. Decreased depth is a sign of potential trend strength.”

Investors can choose a few of the top sectors to create diversification.

Don’t trade low adr stock.

10,20,15 ma 

Ignore 1,2day, sell 1/3 to half on day 345, than surf the 10day MA

***1d use MA, 1H use EMA : it just works Memo earnings, if earnings tripled , it’s fuel.***

# Method

Scan for the 1 or 2% of stocks that are up the most over these 3 timeframes

1-month 3-month 6-month



A range expansion (breakout) out of that consolidation. The consolidation phase is usually 2 weeks to 2 months. During the consolidation the stock price “surfs” the rising 10- and 20-day. and sometimes toe 50-day moving average.



1. Identify the setups. You need to have a watchlist ready before the market open. You should also probably have alerts set, and know how many shares you want to buy.

Enter on the opening range highs. The opening range highs can be the highs of the first 1-minute candle, the 5-minute candle or the 60-minute candle (on the 60-minute timeframe the first candle is always only 30 minutes, 9.30-10 AM). You can use whatever timeframe or a combination of them. You don’t even have to use any intraday chart, just look at the daily chart and enter when the stock is starting to break out.



You should sell 1/3 to 1/2 of the position after 3-5 days, and then move the stop to break even. The rest of the position should be trailed with the 10- or the 20-day moving average. Depends on how fast the stock is. If a beginner stick to the 10-day. You wait for the first CLOSE below the 10- day.



In a bullish market it is very common to get moves that are 10-20x+ your initial risk if you are good at setup selection.

## Episodic Pivot(EP)

**Episodic Pivot (EP)**
 When unexpected good news hits a stock, especially if that stock is neglected, that can trigger multi-month, and multi-year moves.



There are many types of EPs:

Earnings and earnings guidance

Government regulations, political stuff

Biotech related like drug trial results or FDA decisions

Macro and political related

…and many more!



The main ones I focus on are earnings and earnings guidance. When a stock reports unexpected good earnings and guidance, that is often a catalyst for a big and prolonged move.





The steps to this setup are:

1. Gap up 10%+
2. Big volume. If the volume is not there in premarket, it needs to come in at the open. Many times the best ones have traded their average daily volume in the first 15-30 minutes after the open.
3. If an earnings or earnings guidance related EP, there has to be big growth numbers, preferably mid/high or even triple digit EPS and revenue growth and a significant beat to analyst expectations. Many times the smaller stocks don’t have analyst coverage, you just have to trust the numbers and volume.
4. It’s best if the stock has not rallied over the past 3-6 months. If the stock has already made a big, multi month move into the gap-up, is it really a surprise to the market? It’s your job to figure it out!
    Happy hunting!



How do you trade this setup?

1. Identify the setup, this can usually be done in after-hours or pre-market as we are looking for stocks gapping up on news/earnings.
2. Enter opening range highs. ORH can be the highs of the first 1-, 5-, or 60-minute candle. Stop is at the lows of the day.
3. Trail your stop with the 10- or 20 day moving average once they surpass your initial stop.

## The Parabolic Short(or long)

 Think of stocks as rubber bands, if they get really stretched short term, they can have powerful snapbacks. This is by far the riskiest setup if done wrong or if you have issues with not obeying your stops.
 Most of these are short setups, but sometimes there are also good long setups but they don’t occur as often.


 These are the steps for this setup:

1. A stock up 50-100%+ in a few days or weeks (if larger cap) or 300-1000%+ (if smaller cap).
2. The stock should be up 3-5+ days in a row. Many times you have examples where a stock trends higher for weeks or months and then starts speeding up, some just explode from nowhere.

How do you trade this setup?

1. When you think you have identified a candidate you can short on the opening range lows (1-minute, 5-minute candles). You can wait for the first red 5-minute candle in case the stock goes straight up from the open. You can wait for the stock to have the first crack, bounce back into VWAP (the only intraday indicator I really use) and if it fails at VWAP you can enter (or add). The fail could be the first red 1- or 5-minute candle into the VWAP. The stop is highs of the day or if VWAP fail, a reclaim of the VWAP. The key is to get relatively tight and defined stops.
2. The target area is the 10- and 20-day moving averages, that’s where these stocks usually bounce.
3. Don’t be too early. WAIT for the right setup. Let the amateur shorts get run over, that’s where your edge comes in.
4. This setups is not like the Breakout or the EP where you can sometimes get a 30-50x+ risk reward on your trade. This setup is more like 5-10x risk reward, but if you wait for the perfect setups your win rate is probably going to be higher.

MA flat && price surf 50EMA && volume dries up && price get above MA and hold -> long
