# 포커를 하는 이유

포커를 잘하는 사람들이 주식도 잘하는 경우가 많다.

**포커 주식 특징 및 같은 점**

1. 빠른 시간내에 결정을 지어야 한다. 결정을 많이 짓는다. 
2. 정보가 불완전하다
3. 확율 계산이 필요하다

**포커 VS 바둑**

포커와 바둑의 다른 점:포커는 실력과 운의 분배가 적당해서 고수도 초짜한테 질수 있다. 그래서 큰 대회 결승에 올라온 한 테이블 사람들이 그전 해 참가자일 경우는 거의 없다. 하지만 바둑은 다르다. 초짜, 아마츄어가 프로를 절대 이기지 못한다. 바둑을 예시로 했지만 chess, League of Legends 등등 실력이 중요한 게임은 다 해당된다.

**포커 and 현실세계**

그러면 현실 세계는 포커와 같을까 바둑과 같을까? 나는 포커와 같다고 생각한다. 실력도 중요하지만 운도 많이 중요하다고 본다. 그걸 잘 캐치해 내는 사고방식이 필요하다. 포커에서 70% 이길수 있어서 배팅 걸었는데 졌다. 그러면 이건 결과가 나쁘지만 좋은 선택이다. 하지만 30% 이득도 조금만 보는 베팅을 걸었는데 이겼다. 그래도  Expected value 크면 모르겠지만 이건 잘못된 선택이다. 결국 확율을 판단하는게 모두 주관적인 판단이지만 그래도 세상을 흑 과 백으로 보는 것보다는 낫다고 본다.

**목적**

포커로 부자 되고 돈 벌려고 하는건 아니고 사고방식을 얻고 싶다. 살면서 정보가 불완전 할때 결정을 짓는 경우가 많은데 이럴 때 감성적인 아닌 이성적으로 결정을 지을수 있도록. 결과론 적으로 생각하지 않고 결과보다는 선택을 하는 과정에 집중 할수 있도록.

그리고 어떤 일을 하든지 기본확율이 있는데, 사람들이 이걸 무시하는 경우가 많은다. 포커 잘하게 돼서 이걸 까먹지 않도록.

# introduction

Hole card : hidden from view

offsuit: different suit

\+ : indicates that hand stronger than it. (TT+ indicates JJ QQ KK AA / AT+ indicates AJ AQ AK)

Defining two keys : 1.concerning opponent’s range of hands 2.how he will play that range 

## measurements

The term “buy-in” is used to define how much money a person brings to the table.

minimum: 20xbb

maximum: 100xbb

a $0.50/$1 NLHE game is often referred to as a NL100 game

Short stack: 1-40 times the blind

Medium stack: 41-80

Deep stack: 81-100

Effective stack: the smallest stack in a hand

upswings, downswings ::When a player wins or loses a lot of money in a given period of time, these wins or losses are often referred to as swings. 

💲300 in NL100 is 3 buy-in

Bank roll: amount of money a player has that he has available for playing poker with

Bank roll is for winning player, beginner needs budget. At least 30 buy-in for beginner. For professional, at least 100 buy-ins and 6-12 months of living expenses saved on top of that.

If you lose a certain portion of that money , Moving down in bankroll is very common for players. / ex. NL100 to NL 50 ./ “If you don’t stress your bankroll, it will stress you!”



Win rates: if a NL100 player won $1 in 100 hands, he would have a win rate of 1 bb/100 (in terms of big blind) / For a beginner, pay attention to learn the game instead of win rate.

Some players talk as big bets(BB).   Usually, 1 BB/100 is equal to 2 bb/100

## Thinking about bets in No-Limit Hold'em

Think about bet sizes in their relation to the size of the current pot.(like stock percentage)

Min-raise: raise amount is double the size of your opponent’s bet.

Pot-size raise: 1. Take the amount you must call and boule it. 2. Add the results from number one to the size of the pot(including your opponent's bet)

## Your expectations

Many professional poker players consider **30 hours a week** to be a very full schedule. 

if you want to make money, it's good to think in terms of an hourly earn.

Not losing money is quite an accomplishment, because of **rake**. Many online casinos rake 5% of the pot.

# Hit the Deck

outs: is a card that can come on a future streets.

Backdoor outs.      hidden outs        chopping outs

## The 4/2 Rule

Equity or showdown equity::  how often the player will win the hand on average by the river.

## pot odds

starts with comparing the size of the pot with the size of the bet we must call.=> reward to risk ratio. 

Ex: Let's imagine that same $10 pot, except this time our opponent bets $5. Now we're getting 15:5  so the percentage is 25% . **memorize below**

| His Bet                 | We must win> |
| ----------------------- | ------------ |
| 2x the size of the pot  | 40%          |
| Pot-size                | 33%          |
| 2/3 the size of the pot | 28%          |
| 1/2 the size of the pot | 25%          |
| 1/3 the size of the pot | 20%          |
| 1/4 the size of the pot | 16%          |

if equity > pot odds ; then call or check

EV: win rate x(win money) - lose rate x(lose money)=EV

## implied odds

implied odds :: how the decision of whether or not to call or fold is impacted by having money left to bet.

Implied odds are an extension of **pot odds** that help you decide whether or not a drawing hand is worth calling in the face of a raise. Essentially, the **implied odds** of a hand tell you how much you expect to win after you make your draw.

5/(10+5+x)=16% equity ... calculate x

| Our Equity | Multiply his bet by |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| 35%        | 2x                  |
| 25%        | 3x                  |
| 20%        | 4x                  |
| 15%        | 6x                  |
| 10%        | 9x                  |

The money need to become equity:: if equity 35%; then multiply his bet by 2x; then minus pot+opponent's bet = need to be in the pot in the future to make it break even

# World of the Unkown

## combinations

Combination of suited cards:: left cards +...+0

combination of different cards:: one remaining number card x another

possible combinations our opponent can have to give him a flush draw⇩⇩

| Cards Exposed From suit | Possible combinations |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1                       | 66                    |
| 2                       | 55                    |
| 3                       | 45                    |
| 4                       | 36                    |
| 5                       | 28                    |
| 6                       | 21                    |

## Equity Versus a Range

1. Determine your equity against each hand in the range.
2. Multiply that equity by the number of combinations for that hand.
3. Add together the results from step two for each hand in the range.
4. Divide the results from step three by the total combinations in the hand range.

our total equity against his range > pot odds; then play

**quicker method**

Ex: About 75% of the time we have 66% equity, and 25% of the time we have 9% equity.different method below.

1. Find out what 3/4 of 66 is and what 1/4 of 9 is then sum the results.

   3/4 of 66 + 1/4 of 9 = Average Equity

   49.5 + 2.25 = 51.75

2. You have 66% equity 3 times and 9% equity 1 time. You can add those together and divide the sum by four.

   ((66x3)+(9x1))/4 = Average Equity

3. Find 3/4 of the way from 9 to 66. You can do this by subtracting 9 from 66, and then dividing that result by 4. Finally subtract that results from 66.

   66-9=57       57/4 =14.         66-14=52

4. The mental slider method finding 3/4 of the way from 9 to 66.
