# 포커를 하는 이유

포커를 잘하는 사람들이 주식도 잘하는 경우가 많다.

**포커 주식 특징 및 같은 점**

1. 빠른 시간내에 결정을 지어야 한다. 결정을 많이 짓는다. 
2. 정보가 불완전하다
3. 확율 계산이 필요하다

**포커 VS 바둑**

포커와 바둑의 다른 점:포커는 실력과 운의 분배가 적당해서 고수도 초짜한테 질수 있다. 그래서 큰 대회 결승에 올라온 한 테이블 사람들이 그전 해 참가자일 경우는 거의 없다. 하지만 바둑은 다르다. 초짜, 아마츄어가 프로를 절대 이기지 못한다. 바둑을 예시로 했지만 chess, League of Legends 등등 실력이 중요한 게임은 다 해당된다.

**포커 and 현실세계**

그러면 현실 세계는 포커와 같을까 바둑과 같을까? 나는 포커와 같다고 생각한다. 실력도 중요하지만 운도 많이 중요하다고 본다. 그걸 잘 캐치해 내는 사고방식이 필요하다. 포커에서 70% 이길수 있어서 배팅 걸었는데 졌다. 그러면 이건 결과가 나쁘지만 좋은 선택이다. 하지만 30% 이득도 조금만 보는 베팅을 걸었는데 이겼다. 그래도  Expected value 크면 모르겠지만 이건 잘못된 선택이다. 결국 확율을 판단하는게 모두 주관적인 판단이지만 그래도 세상을 흑 과 백으로 보는 것보다는 낫다고 본다.

**목적**

포커로 부자 되고 돈 벌려고 하는건 아니고 사고방식을 얻고 싶다. 살면서 정보가 불완전 할때 결정을 짓는 경우가 많은데 이럴 때 감성적인 아닌 이성적으로 결정을 지을수 있도록. 결과론 적으로 생각하지 않고 결과보다는 선택을 하는 과정에 집중 할수 있도록.

그리고 어떤 일을 하든지 기본확율이 있는데, 사람들이 이걸 무시하는 경우가 많은다. 포커 잘하게 돼서 이걸 까먹지 않도록.

# introduction

Hole card : hidden from view

offsuit: different suit

\+ : indicates that hand stronger than it. (TT+ indicates JJ QQ KK AA / AT+ indicates AJ AQ AK)

Defining two keys : 1.concerning opponent’s range of hands 2.how he will play that range 

## measurements

The term “buy-in” is used to define how much money a person brings to the table.

minimum: 20xbb

maximum: 100xbb

a $0.50/$1 NLHE game is often referred to as a NL100 game

Short stack: 1-40 times the blind

Medium stack: 41-80

Deep stack: 81-100

Effective stack: the smallest stack in a hand

upswings, downswings ::When a player wins or loses a lot of money in a given period of time, these wins or losses are often referred to as swings. 

💲300 in NL100 is 3 buy-in

Bank roll: amount of money a player has that he has available for playing poker with

Bank roll is for winning player, beginner needs budget. At least 30 buy-in for beginner. For professional, at least 100 buy-ins and 6-12 months of living expenses saved on top of that.

If you lose a certain portion of that money , Moving down in bankroll is very common for players. / ex. NL100 to NL 50 ./ “If you don’t stress your bankroll, it will stress you!”



Win rates: if a NL100 player won $1 in 100 hands, he would have a win rate of 1 bb/100 (in terms of big blind) / For a beginner, pay attention to learn the game instead of win rate.

Some players talk as big bets(BB).   Usually, 1 BB/100 is equal to 2 bb/100

## Thinking about bets in No-Limit Hold'em

Think about bet sizes in their relation to the size of the current pot.(like stock percentage)

Min-raise: raise amount is double the size of your opponent’s bet.

Pot-size raise: 1. Take the amount you must call and boule it. 2. Add the results from number one to the size of the pot(including your opponent's bet)

## Your expectations

Many professional poker players consider **30 hours a week** to be a very full schedule. 

if you want to make money, it's good to think in terms of an hourly earn.

Not losing money is quite an accomplishment, because of **rake**. Many online casinos rake 5% of the pot.

# Hit the Deck

outs: is a card that can come on a future streets.

Backdoor outs.      hidden outs        chopping outs

## The 4/2 Rule

Equity or showdown equity::  how often the player will win the hand on average by the river.

## pot odds

starts with comparing the size of the pot with the size of the bet we must call.=> reward to risk ratio. 

Ex: Let's imagine that same $10 pot, except this time our opponent bets $5. Now we're getting 15:5  so the percentage is 25% . **memorize below**

| His Bet                 | We must win> |
| ----------------------- | ------------ |
| 2x the size of the pot  | 40%          |
| Pot-size                | 33%          |
| 2/3 the size of the pot | 28%          |
| 1/2 the size of the pot | 25%          |
| 1/3 the size of the pot | 20%          |
| 1/4 the size of the pot | 16%          |

if equity > pot odds ; then call or check

EV: win rate x(win money) - lose rate x(lose money)=EV

## implied odds

implied odds :: how the decision of whether or not to call or fold is impacted by having money left to bet.

Implied odds are an extension of **pot odds** that help you decide whether or not a drawing hand is worth calling in the face of a raise. Essentially, the **implied odds** of a hand tell you how much you expect to win after you make your draw.

5/(10+5+x)=16% equity ... calculate x

| Our Equity | Multiply his bet by |
| ---------- | ------------------- |
| 35%        | 2x                  |
| 25%        | 3x                  |
| 20%        | 4x                  |
| 15%        | 6x                  |
| 10%        | 9x                  |

The money need to become equity:: if equity 35%; then multiply his bet by 2x; then minus pot+opponent's bet = need to be in the pot in the future to make it break even

# World of the Unkown

## combinations

Combination of suited cards:: left cards +...+0

combination of different cards:: one remaining number card x another

possible combinations our opponent can have to give him a flush draw⇩⇩

| Cards Exposed From suit | Possible combinations |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| 1                       | 66                    |
| 2                       | 55                    |
| 3                       | 45                    |
| 4                       | 36                    |
| 5                       | 28                    |
| 6                       | 21                    |

## Equity Versus a Range

1. Determine your equity against each hand in the range.
2. Multiply that equity by the number of combinations for that hand.
3. Add together the results from step two for each hand in the range.
4. Divide the results from step three by the total combinations in the hand range.

our total equity against his range > pot odds; then play

**quicker method**

Ex: About 75% of the time we have 66% equity, and 25% of the time we have 9% equity.different method below.

1. Find out what 3/4 of 66 is and what 1/4 of 9 is then sum the results.

   3/4 of 66 + 1/4 of 9 = Average Equity

   49.5 + 2.25 = 51.75

2. You have 66% equity 3 times and 9% equity 1 time. You can add those together and divide the sum by four.

   ((66x3)+(9x1))/4 = Average Equity

3. Find 3/4 of the way from 9 to 66. You can do this by subtracting 9 from 66, and then dividing that result by 4. Finally subtract that results from 66.

   66-9=57       57/4 =14.         66-14=52

4. The mental slider method finding 3/4 of the way from 9 to 66.

### Bluffing

| ratio                 | Cosndering Bluffing | Considering Calling | Must be Good> |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| Risking x to win 5x   | Pot-Size Raise      |                     | 67%           |
| Risking x to win 8x   | 1/2 Pot-Size Raise  |                     | 55%           |
| Risking x to win x    | Pot Bet             | Never Happens       | 50%           |
| Risking x to win 1.5x | 2/3 Pot Bet         | Call 2x Pot         | 40%           |
| Risking x to win 2x   | 1/2 Pot Bet         | Call Pot            | 33%           |
| Risking x to win 3x   | 1/3 Pot Bet         | Call 1/2 Pot        | 25%           |

Making a pot-size raise is much different than making a pot-size bet because you have to put a lot more money in the pot to offer your opponent.

As we lower our bet size, his calling range increases, as we raise our bet size, is calling range decreases.

**how to calculate**:  (fold combinations)/ (fold + call combinations) > must be good 

## semi-bluffing

Bluffing and semi-bluffing bring us into the world of **fold equity**. Fold equity is a term we use to describe what we gain when our opponent folds.

**Semi-bluffing** is when you're betting with a hand you doubt is good right now but has a good chance to improve on a later street. Because of this, you cannot semi-bluff on the river.

Fold%(pot won when he folds) + call%(amount we win/lose when he calls)

- The size of the pot in relation to the money left. The larger the stack to pot ratio, the more often he must fold. This is because we're proportionally risking more.

**shortcut**

1. Total pot size times our equity
2. Subtract the result from step one from our bet
3. Examine the reward(result from 2) to risk ratio.

## Value-Betting

Value-Betting: the term is reserved for betting when we believe we have the best hand. We're trying to extract as much value as we can when we actually have the goods.

Ex: beat QT, AJ 20com,lose QJ J9 15com. villain call 20, is a $20 value bet profitable?

(rate of winning range)x(money win) - (lose range)(-money win)=EV

0.57x($20)-0.43x(-$20)=EV

when bluffing: bluffing range x all money lose (cause I will fold, calling with more than 50% worse hand)

# At the Table

## A Bit of Memory

Unpaired hands in the exmaples are all offsuit holdings. 

When you hold a suited hand instead of an offsuit hand, your preflop equity generally increase by about 4%.

Table. All-in preflop equity for hand groups.

| Situation                   | Exmaple    | Equities   |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Overcard VS 2 middle cards  | A8o vs QJo | 57% vs 43% |
| Overcard VS 1 middle cards  | ATo vs Q7o | 65% vs 35% |
| 2 overcards vs 2 undercards | 55 vs AKo  | 55% vs 45% |
| Pair VS 1 overcard          | 88 vs A2o  | 70% vs 30% |
| Pair VS 2 undercards        | KK vs 87o  | 82% vs 18% |
| Pair vs undercard           | AA vs AKo  | 93% vs 7%  |
| Overpair vs Underpair       | AA vs 55   | 81% vs 19% |

Another good thing to commit to memory is strong preflop hands compared to strong preflop ranges.

| 1-Grapper       | Open-ended straight draw | 8%         |

Table. Clashing flops. The equities given are assuming you will be seeing both the turn and the river.

| Situation                      | Example                           | First Hand's Equity |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Flush draw vs. set             | AsJs vs 8d8h<br />Board: 2s3d8s   | 26%                 |
| Overpair vs pair+flush draw    | AdAs vs. 5h7h<br />BoardZ: Jh2h7c | 50%                 |
| Pair vs. flush draw + overcard | AcJc vs. KhKd<br />Board: 2c7cJh  | 52%                 |

These are some of the more common situations I commit to memory. Again, you may discover you’re thinking heavily about a certain situation frequently while playing. If that’s the case, be sure to analyze that situation and commit it to memory so you’re not spending energy on it at the poker table.

## Chunking

Beginning players often **slowplay** a big hand on the flop and/or turn only to discover they now have a tiny pot on the river and a bunch of money behind. Out of desperation to get paid off with their big hand, they often shove all the money in the middle,making a massive **overbet**. Learning how to chunk your stack in order to comfortably get all-in is a very important no-limit skill. It's betting with purpose. This math is a little different than what we've covered so far as it's not counting combinations or estimating equity. We're simply figuring out how to divide our stack up into chunks. 

Danger of slowplay: Seriously reduce exponential growth of the pot over multiple streets.

How might we create smaller SPRs?  By raising larger preflop.

my recommendation for many beginners is to start with a **40x** stack. 

Table. Chuking options with common SPRs(stack to pot ratio)

| SPR  | Chunking Option              |
| ---- | ---------------------------- |
| 13   | Pot, pot, pot                |
| 9    | Pot, 3/4 pot, 3/4 pot        |
| 7    | 3/4 pot, 3/4 pot, 3/4pot     |
| 5.5  | Pot, half-pot, half-pot      |
| 3.5  | Half-pot, half-pot, half-pot |

## Set-Mining

Sets are one of the biggest money makers in any poker player’s database of hands. 

Many players have gotten into the habit of calling with any pocket pair and then simply folding if they do not flop a set. However, if they do flop a set, they do their best to get all the money in the middle. Let’s begin approaching set-mining through the most optimistic eyes.

## How Much to Bet?

Now we’re going to look at sizing our bets given our opponent’s range when we’re on the flop and turn. 

beginners default to a 2/3 pot bet

Thinking about maximizing value from your opponent’s range always takes precedence over making bets to chunk in your stack. 

## Balanced Play

balance = optimal play = game theory optimal play = balanced paly

Exploitive play is a more responsive form of poker::

•If he folds too much, we bluff more.

• If he calls too much, we bluff less.

• If he bluffs too much, we call more.

• If he bluffs too little, we call less. 



Playing a maximally exploitive strategy has us making drastic changes in our play. 

- opponent has only bluffs, and bluffs 33% of time; then we should call 100% of the time
- we know our opponent is never bluffing. ; then we obvisouly never call.
- if our opponent bluffs 50% (or 34% or 100%) of the time? ; then call 100% of the time 
- if our opponents only bluffing 25% of the time; then we should always fold.

so, you see that a maximally exploitive strategy has us making very dramatic swings in our decision frequencies. We go from always calling to never caling and vice versa.

---

developing a perfectly balanced game of poker is not a possibility. 

exploitive play is when we're playing against opponents who have a static strategy or predictably changing strategy

 There are only two practical reasons why we would want to try to play a balanced game. One would be that we have no information on our opponent.The second reason to play a balanced game is because our opponent is better at exploitive play than we are. 



By the time a struggling small-stakes player can begin developing a balanced game, they’d be better off exploiting all the bad players.



**Value**:: grow poker theory and come up with new ideas.
