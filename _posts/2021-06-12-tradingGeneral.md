“If you use Stochastic as a stand-alone oscillator, a longer Stochastic is preferable. If you use Stochastic as part of a trading system, combined with trend-following indicators, then a shorter Stochastic is preferable.”

“As a rule of thumb, **“high volume”** for any given market is at least **25 percent above** its average for the past two weeks, while “low volume” is at least 25 percent below

“The Impulse system encourages you to enter cautiously but exit fast. This is the professional approach to trading. Beginners tend to do the opposite; jump into trades and then take forever to exit, hoping for the market to turn their way.”

# Peter lynch Classifies stocks into 6 Groups

1. Fast growers. 25%+ earnings growth.

2. Medium growers (stalwarts). Steady 10-12% earnings growth.

3. Slow growers (sluggards). No or very little growth but they often pay generous dividends.

4. Cyclicals. Sales and profits fall and rise in regular but not completely predictable fashion. These do well when economies come out of a recession and begin to expand.

5. Turnarounds. Stocks that go through deep troubles and their survival may come into question. If they manage to fix their issues they can have big rebounds that are the lest correlated to the overall market.

6. Asset plays. Hidden assets.

I want to operate in stages 5-8 on the table and mainly in the fast growers among the Lynch definitions. But I can’t rule out operating in turnarounds and cyclicals occasionally.
