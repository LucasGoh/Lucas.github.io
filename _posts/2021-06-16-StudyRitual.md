# study method to come over Procrastination

1. clear the clutter

2. Coffee / water / banana

   Prepare food

3. block all distractions

   phone, do not disturb mode, other stuff

4. chant (better do it with physical action) / mantra

   it works as ritual before study.

   My chant: Lord's Prayer "though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death, i shall fear no evil."

   I'm not christian, I read someone do this on the internet.

5. audio / music

   **same** playplist or style of music when you study.



## why ritual / chanting ?

If you always focus on specific activities at certain times of the day, or if you dedicate blocks of time and energy for your **ritual**, you are far more likely to settle into a state of immersion in your work. You make your **rituals**, then your **rituals** make you.
